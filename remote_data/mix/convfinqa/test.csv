deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained . the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors ,

instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices . daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels . the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that

risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis . the
