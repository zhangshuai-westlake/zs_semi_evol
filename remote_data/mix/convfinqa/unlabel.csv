"operating profit for the segment decreased by 1% ( 1 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . for the year , operating profit declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s

volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship

at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively . furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that

additional collateral . these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 . credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) . credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring . the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event . the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes . first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers . as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity . second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages . see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures . in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives . following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives . credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below . the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations . single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts . single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments . like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities . new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets . if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index . cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure . such structures are commonly known as tranche cds . for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity . the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value . the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs . credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor . under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity . the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event . in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .

the shutdown of our courtland , alabama mill ) in 2014 and a gain of $ 36 million ( $ 154 million excluding costs associated with the courtland mill shutdown ) in 2013 . sales volumes in 2015 decreased compared with 2014 primarily due to the closure of our courtland mill in 2014 . shipments to the domestic market increased , but export shipments declined . average sales price realizations decreased , primarily in the domestic market . input costs were lower , mainly for energy . planned maintenance downtime costs were $ 12 million higher in 2015 . operating profits in 2014 were negatively impacted by costs associated with the shutdown of our courtland , alabama mill . entering the first quarter of 2016 , sales volumes are expected to be up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 . average sales margins should be about flat reflecting lower average sales price realizations offset by a more favorable product mix . input costs are expected to be stable . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 14 million lower with an outage scheduled in the 2016 first quarter at our georgetown mill compared with outages at our eastover and riverdale mills in the 2015 fourth quarter . in january 2015 , the united steelworkers , domtar corporation , packaging corporation of america , finch paper llc and p . h . glatfelter company ( the petitioners

petition with these agencies regarding imports of the products from china and indonesia . in january 2016 , the doc announced its final countervailing duty rates on imports of the products to the united states from certain producers from china and indonesia . also , in january 2016 , the doc announced its final anti-dumping duty rates on imports of the products to the united states from certain producers from australia , brazil , china , indonesia and portugal . in february 2016 , the itc concluded its anti- dumping and countervailing duties investigations and made a final determination that the u.s . market had been injured by imports of the products . accordingly , the doc 2019s previously announced countervailing duty rates and anti-dumping duty rates will be in

"foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non-u.s . companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies . therefore , foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies . foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process . locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory require- ments and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations . the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling , the euro , and the canadian dollar . the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december 31 , 2008 and 2007. . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>( in millions of u.s . dollars )</td><td>2008</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies</td><td>$

hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u.s . dollar</td><td>$ 84</td><td>$ 150</td></tr></table> reinsurance of gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher

","foreign currency exchange rate risk many of our non-u.s . companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies . therefore , foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies . foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process . locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory require- ments and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations . the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling , the euro , and the canadian dollar . the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december 31 , 2008 and 2007. . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>( in millions of u.s . dollars )</td><td>2008</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies</td><td>$

hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u.s . dollar</td><td>$ 84</td><td>$ 150</td></tr></table> reinsurance of gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization . however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income . as of december 31 , 2008 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 2008 . management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term

",Answer: 237.5
"long-term product offerings include active and index strategies . our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile . we offer two types of active strategies : those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . althoughmany clients use both active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2015 equity aum totaled $ 2.424 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 52.8 billion . net inflows included $ 78.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion into ishares and active products , respectively . ishares net inflows were driven by the core series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures , and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities . ishares and active net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 29.8 billion . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aummix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which do not consistently move in tandemwith u.s . markets , may have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s effective equity fee rates and revenues . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2015 at $ 1.422 trillion , increasing $ 28.7 billion , or 2% ( 2 % ) , from december 31 , 2014 . the increase in aum reflected $ 76.9 billion in net inflows , partially offset by $ 48.2 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements . in 2015 , active net inflows of $ 35.9 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings , with strong flows into our unconstrained , total return and high yield strategies . flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained strategic income opportunities and fixed income strategies funds , with net inflows of $ 7.0 billion and $ 3.7 billion , respectively ; our total return fund with net inflows of $ 2.7 billion ; and our high yield bond fund with net inflows of $ 3.5 billion . fixed income ishares net inflows of $ 50.3 billion were led by flows into core , corporate and high yield bond funds . active and ishares net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 9.3 billion . multi-asset class blackrock 2019s multi-asset class teammanages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , bonds , currencies and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset class aum for 2015 are presented below .

","long-term product offerings include active and index strategies . our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile . we offer two types of active strategies : those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . althoughmany clients use both active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2015 equity aum totaled $ 2.424 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 52.8 billion . net inflows included $ 78.4 billion and $ 4.2 billion into ishares and active products , respectively . ishares net inflows were driven by the core series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures , and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities . ishares and active net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 29.8 billion . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aummix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which do not consistently move in tandemwith u.s . markets , may have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s effective equity fee rates and revenues . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2015 at $ 1.422 trillion , increasing $ 28.7 billion , or 2% ( 2 % ) , from december 31 , 2014 . the increase in aum reflected $ 76.9 billion in net inflows , partially offset by $ 48.2 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements . in 2015 , active net inflows of $ 35.9 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings , with strong flows into our unconstrained , total return and high yield strategies . flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained strategic income opportunities and fixed income strategies funds , with net inflows of $ 7.0 billion and $ 3.7 billion , respectively ; our total return fund with net inflows of $ 2.7 billion ; and our high yield bond fund with net inflows of $ 3.5 billion . fixed income ishares net inflows of $ 50.3 billion were led by flows into core , corporate and high yield bond funds . active and ishares net inflows were partially offset by non-etf index net outflows of $ 9.3 billion . multi-asset class blackrock 2019s multi-asset class teammanages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , bonds , currencies and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset class aum for 2015 are presented below .
