1575,2022-12-15T13:52:11.012323,The graph of the equation \[ x^2 + 4y^2 - 10x + 56y = k\]is a non-degenerate ellipse if and only if $k > a.$ What is $a?$,"To find the value of $a,$ I need to complete the squares for both $x$ and $y$ in the equation.

I can rewrite the equation as \[ (x^2 - 10x) + 4(y^2 + 14y) = k.\]

To complete the square for $x,$ I need to add $(10/2)^2 = 25$ to both sides. To complete the square for $y,$ I need to add $4(14/2)^2 = 196$ to both sides.

This gives me \[ (x^2 - 10x + 25) + 4(y^2 + 14y + 49) = k + 25 + 196.\]

Simplifying, I get \[ (x - 5)^2 + 4(y + 7)^2 = k + 221.\]

Now I can see that this is the equation of an ellipse with center at $(5, -7)$ and axes parallel to the coordinate axes.

For the ellipse to be non-degenerate, the right-hand side of the equation must be positive, so $k + 221 > 0.$

Solving for $k,$ I get $k > -221.$

5054,2022-11-20T15:58:02.478259,How many zeros are at the end of (100!)(200!)(300!) when multiplied out?,"I know that a zero at the end of a number means that it is divisible by 10, which is the product of 2 and 5.

So, to count the zeros at the end of a product, I need to count how many factors of 2 and 5 are in the product.

I also know that there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in a product of consecutive numbers, because 2 is smaller than 5 and appears more often.

Therefore, the number of zeros at the end of a product is equal to the number of factors of 5 in the product.

To find the number of factors of 5 in (100!)(200!)(300!), I can use a formula that counts the number of factors of a prime p in n!, which is [n/p] + [n/p^2] + [n/p^3] + ..., where [x] means the largest integer less than or equal to x.

For example, the number of factors of 5 in 100! is [100/5] + [100/25] + [100/125] + ... = 20 + 4 + 0 + ... = 24.

Similarly, the number of factors of 5 in 200! is [200/5] + [200/25] + [200/125] + ... = 40 + 8 + 1 + ... = 49.

And the number of factors of 5 in 300! is [300/5] + [300/25] + [300/125] + ... = 60 + 12 + 2 + ... = 74.

Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in (100!)(200!)(300!) is 24 + 49 + 74 = 147.

This means that there are 147 zeros at the end of (100!)(200!)(300!) when multiplied out.

1095,2022-12-16T04:43:52.269074,Find all values of $r$ such that $\lfloor r \rfloor + r = 16.5$.,"Therefore, $r$ must be a decimal number with a fractional part of 0.5, since adding it to an integer gives 16.5.

So, I can write $r$ as $n + 0.5$, where $n$ is an integer.

Substituting this into the equation, I get $\lfloor n + 0.5 \rfloor + n + 0.5 = 16.5$.

I can simplify this by noting that $\lfloor n + 0.5 \rfloor = n$, since $n$ is already an integer and adding 0.5 does not change that.

So, I have $n + n + 0.5 = 16.5$, which implies that $2n = 16$.

Solving for $n$, I get $n = 8$.

Therefore, $r = n + 0.5 = 8.5$.

I can check that this works by plugging it back into the original equation: $\lfloor 8.5 \rfloor + 8.5 = 16.5$, which is true.

In this problem, we are given that a_1 = 729 and a_7 = 64.

We can use these values to find r by plugging them into the general formula: 64 = 729 * r^(7-1).

Taking the sixth root of both sides, we get r = (64/729)^(1/6).

This is a positive, real number, but it is not very nice to work with.

We can simplify it by noticing that both 64 and 729 are perfect cubes: 64 = 4^3 and 729 = 9^3.

This is much better: r is the square root of 4/9, or 2/3.

I want to find a way to express the coolness of each animal in terms of a common unit, so I can compare them more easily.

I notice that both cats and pandas are related to alpacas through the given ratios, so I can use alpacas as the common unit.

To do that, I need to find how many alpacas are equivalent to one cat and one panda.

I can use the first ratio to find the alpaca equivalent of one cat.

If 2 cats are as cool as 5 alpacas, then one cat must be as cool as 2.5 alpacas, since I can divide both sides of the ratio by 2.

Similarly, I can use the second ratio to find the alpaca equivalent of one panda.

If 3 pandas are as cool as 7 cats, then one panda must be as cool as 7/3 cats, since I can divide both sides of the ratio by 3.

But I want to express this in terms of alpacas, not cats.

So I can multiply the cat equivalent of one panda by the alpaca equivalent of one cat, and get the alpaca equivalent of one panda.

Now I have the coolness of each animal in terms of alpacas, and I can use this to answer the question.

I want to find how many pandas are as cool as 70 alpacas.

To do that, I need to divide 70 alpacas by the alpaca equivalent of one panda, and get the panda equivalent of 70 alpacas.

So I can multiply the cat equivalent of one panda by the alpaca equivalent of one cat, and get the alpaca equivalent of one panda.

That is, one panda is as cool as (7/3) * (2.5) = 35/6 alpacas.

Now I have the coolness of each animal in terms of alpacas, and I can use this to answer the question.

I want to find how many pandas are as cool as 70 alpacas.

To do that, I need to divide 70 alpacas by the alpaca equivalent of one panda, and get the panda equivalent of 70 alpacas.

That is, 70 alpacas are as cool as 70 / (35/6) = 12 pandas, since I can multiply both sides of the ratio by 6/35.

So the final answer is 12.

What should the side of the square be if he wants to use the least amount of fencing?,"To minimize the amount of fencing, Luke should make the square as small as possible, while still having an area of at least 400 square feet.

The area of a square is the square of its side, so I can write an equation: s^2 = 400, where s is the side of the square.

To solve for s, I can take the square root of both sides: s = sqrt(400).

The square root of 400 is 20, so the side of the square should be 20 feet.

So, I'm looking for the value of $x$ that satisfies $5^x = \frac{1}{625}$.

I notice that $625$ is a power of $5$, namely $5^4$.

So, I can rewrite the equation as $5^x = \frac{1}{5^4}$.

To get the same base on both sides, I can use the exponent rule that says $\frac{1}{a^b} = a^{-b}$.

So, I get $5^x = 5^{-4}$.

Now, I can see that the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold, so $x = -4$.

Therefore, the logarithm I want to find is $\log_5\frac{1}{625} = -4$.

Let me call the smaller number x and the larger number y, so I have x + y = 15 and 4x = 2y - 60.

I can try to solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination.

Substitution might be easier, since I can easily isolate x or y from the first equation.

If I solve for y, I get y = 15 - x, and then I can plug that into the second equation.

So I have 4x = 2(15 - x) - 60, which simplifies to 4x = 30 - 2x - 60, and then to 6x = -30.

Dividing both sides by 6, I get x = -5.

That means the smaller number is -5, and the larger number is 15 - (-5) = 20.

I can check my answer by plugging it back into the original equations.

The floor function, denoted by $\lfloor x \rfloor$, rounds x down to the nearest integer.

The ceiling function, denoted by $\lceil x \rceil$, rounds x up to the nearest integer.

To evaluate this expression, I need to work from the inside out, applying the functions in the correct order.

First, I will evaluate the innermost expression, which is $\left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2$.

To do this, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by themselves: $\left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2=\frac{169}{49}$.

Next, I will apply the ceiling function to this fraction.

To do this, I need to round it up to the nearest integer.

Since $\frac{169}{49}$ is between 3 and 4, the nearest integer that is greater than or equal to it is 4.

So, $\lceil \left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2 \rceil = 4$.

Now, I will evaluate the next expression, which is $\lceil \left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2 \rceil+\frac{17}{4}$.

To do this, I can substitute 4 for $\lceil \left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2 \rceil$ and add the fractions.

To add the fractions, I need a common denominator, which is 4.

So, $\lceil \left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2 \rceil+\frac{17}{4}=\frac{4}{1}+\frac{17}{4}=\frac{16}{4}+\frac{17}{4}=\frac{33}{4}$.

Finally, I will apply the floor function to this fraction.

To do this, I need to round it down to the nearest integer.

Since $\frac{33}{4}$ is between 8 and 9, the nearest integer that is less than or equal to it is 8.

So, $\lfloor \lceil \left(\frac{13}{7}\right)^2 \rceil+\frac{17}{4} \rfloor = 8$.

One way to approach this is to use the combination formula, which tells us how many ways to choose r items from a set of n items, regardless of the order of the selection.

The combination formula is nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!), where n! is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

To choose one topping from six toppings, we have 6C1 = 6!/(1!(6-1)!) = 6!/5! = 6 ways.

To choose two toppings from six toppings, we have 6C2 = 6!/(2!(6-2)!) = 6!/(2!4!) = (6*5*4!)/(2*4!) = 15 ways.

I can use the fact that it is perpendicular to the given line and has a $y$-intercept of 2 to find its equation.

Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other, so I can find the slope of the given line by rearranging it into slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

To do that, I subtract $3x$ from both sides and divide everything by $-2$, and I get $y = \frac{3}{2}x - 3$.
