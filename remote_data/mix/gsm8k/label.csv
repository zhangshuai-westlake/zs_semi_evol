"Olaf collects colorful toy cars. At first, his collection consisted of 150 cars. His family, knowing his hobby, decided to give him some toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?","Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars,
Mom has given Olaf 5 more toy cars than Dad, so 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 toy cars
Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars,
Uncle has given 1 less toy than Auntie, so 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 toy cars
Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 toy cars.
All the family together gave Olaf 10 +15 + 6 + 5 + 10 = <<10+15+6+5+10=46>>46.
Adding the cars Olaf already had, Olaf's collection has 150 + 46 = <<150+46=196>>196 cars.

"Emma's bank account has $100 in it. Each day of the week, she spends $8. At the end of the week, she goes to the bank and asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her. She leaves the rest in the account. How many dollars remain in the account?","She spend $56 because 7 x 8 = <<7*8=56>>56
She has $44 left in the bank because 100 - 56 = <<100-56=44>>44
She can get 8 five dollar bills because 44 / 5 = <<44/5=8.8>>8.8
This is equal to $40 because 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40
She has $4 left in the account because 44 - 40 = <<44-40=4>>4

"Ezekiel hikes as a hobby. This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?","After the first day, Ezekiel had 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 kilometers of the hike left.
On the second day, he covered 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 kilometers.
Therefore, on the third day, he had 40 - 25 = <<40-25=15>>15 kilometers left to finish the hike.

"James decides to build a tin house by collecting 500 tins in a week. On the first day, he collects 50 tins. On the second day, he manages to collect 3 times that number. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?","On the second day, he collected 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day, which is 3*50 = <<3*50=150>>150 tins.
On the third day, he collected 50 tins fewer than the second day, which is 150-50 = <<150-50=100>>100 tins
The total for the three days is 150+100+50 = <<150+100+50=300>>300 tins.
To reach his goal, he still needs 500-300 = <<500-300=200>>200 tins.
Since the total number of days left in the week is 4, he'll need to collect 200/4 = <<200/4=50>>50 tins per day to reach his goal

"TreQuan is throwing rocks in the river and he notices that the bigger the rock, the wider the splash. Pebbles make a splash that is a 1/4 meter wide. Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?","The pebble's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 6 times 1/4 equals <<6*1/4=1.5>>1.5.
The rock's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 3 times 1/2 equals <<3*1/2=1.5>>1.5.
The boulder's total splash width is 4 because 2 times 2 equals four.
The total splash width for all the rocks is 7 because 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 4 equals 7.

He can make 9 omelets because 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9
Each person gets 3 omelets because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

"Thomas made 4 stacks of wooden blocks. The first stack was 7 blocks tall. The second stack was 3 blocks taller than the first. The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?","The second stack has 7 blocks + 3 blocks = <<7+3=10>>10 blocks.
The third stack has 10 blocks - 6 blocks = <<10-6=4>>4 blocks.
The fourth stack has 4 blocks + 10 blocks = <<4+10=14>>14 blocks.
The fifth stack has 10 blocks x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 blocks.
In total there are 7 blocks + 10 blocks + 4 blocks + 14 blocks + 20 blocks = <<7+10+4+14+20=55>>55 blocks.

"Patricia is making a highlight film about her basketball team. She recorded video of every player and plans to put it all together in a longer movie.

How on average, how many minutes does each player get?","The total movie is 600 seconds long because 130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = <<130+145+85+60+180=600>>600
The total movie is 10 minutes long because 600 / 60 = <<600/60=10>>10
On average each player gets 2 minutes because 10 / 5 = <<10/5=2>>2

"Julie, Letitia and Anton decided to have dinner together at a nearby restaurant.  Julie orders $10 worth of food, Letitia orders $20 worth of food, and Anton orders $30 worth of food.  How much should each pay in tips if they want to split a 20% tip for the whole meal evenly?","First, we need to determine how much the entire meal costs before we can determine the tip. We perform 10+20+30=<<10+20+30=60>>60 dollars worth of food.
Now we need to find out how much the total tip to be paid is, by multiplying 60*.2=12 dollars in tips.
Since they want to split this evenly amongst three people, this works out to 12/3= <<12/3=4>>4 dollars in tips per person.

Niko has bought 9 pairs of socks that cost $2 each and plans to resell them. He wants to gain 25% profit from four of the pairs of socks and $0.2 profit each for the other 5 pairs of socks. How much will his total profit be?,"Niko will earn $2 x 25/100 = $<<2*25/100=0.5>>0.5 profit for each of the first four pairs of socks.
So, his total profit for the four pairs of socks will be $0.5 x 4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2.
His total earnings for the 5 pairs of socks is $0.2 x 5 = $<<0.2*5=1>>1.
Therefore, his total profit will be $2 + $1 = $<<2+1=3>>3.

"The number of short students in a class is 2/5 of the total number of students. If there are 90 tall students, and the class has 400 students, calculate the total number of students with average height.","The number of short students in the class is 2/5*400 = <<2/5*400=160>>160
The total number of short and tall students is 160+90 = <<160+90=250>>250
Since there are 400 students in the class, the number of students with average height is 400-250 = <<400-250=150>>150
