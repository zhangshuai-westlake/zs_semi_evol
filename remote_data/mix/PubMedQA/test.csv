25274085,"(BACKGROUND) Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different loci have been associated with breast cancer susceptibility, accounting for around 10% of the familial component. Recent studies have found direct associations between specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic information.
(METHODS) Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's concordance index (1 - c-index).
(RESULTS) 548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2. By fitting Cox models and random survival forests, including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables, average 1 - c-index values were 0.221 (st.dev. 0.019) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 (st.dev. 0.018) for BRCA2 carriers.

(POPULATION) Persons younger than 76 years with type 2 diabetes whose disease had not been controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents alone. A total of 64 insulin-naive patients treated with maximal feasible dosages of sulfonylurea and metformin (baseline glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c]=8.5%) were randomly assigned to insulin monotherapy (IM group; n=31) or insulin in addition to unchanged oral hypoglycemic medication (IC group; n=33) for 12 months. Insulin doses were adjusted to obtain fasting glucose<7.0 mmol/L and postprandial glucose<10.0 mmol/L.
(OUTCOMES MEASURED) Outcome measures included HbA1c, treatment failure, weight, hypoglycemic events and symptoms, satisfaction with treatment, general well-being, and fear of injecting insulin and testing.
(RESULTS) HbA1c improved from 8.3% to 7.6% in the IC group, and from 8.8% to 7.6% in the IM group (P=NS). The IC group had 24% treatment failures, compared with 2% in the IM group (P=.09).

12163782,"(OBJECTIVE) Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.
(DESIGN) Prospective observational study.
(SETTING) University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology.
(PATIENTS) Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score>or = 18.
(MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS) Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05). Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers.

(METHODS) Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations.
(RESULTS) At full term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites.

Immunoassays commonly used in clinical laboratories measure intact hCG, total beta hCG (intact hCG + hCG free beta-subunit), and/or hCG free beta-subunit. Measurement of serum concentrations of hCG is useful for confirmation and monitoring of pregnancy, diagnosis of trophoblastic diseases and monitoring of the efficacy of treatment, and prenatal screening. Correctly reporting results for the various forms of hCG is clinically important.
(METHOD) We prepared samples by addition of intact hCG and hCG free beta-subunit to an essentially hCG-free human serum matrix. The samples were analyzed by participant laboratories using various immunoassay methods.
(RESULTS) We identified errors in participant reporting of intact hCG results as total beta hCG (9.3%; 22 of 235 laboratories) and total beta hCG as intact hCG (13.1%; 8 of 61 laboratories).

18708308,"(BACKGROUND) Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
(METHODS) The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
(RESULTS) Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

12790890,"(PURPOSE) Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.
(METHODS) We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).
(RESULTS) Unlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining.
